        <h1>Statement of the Problem</h1>

        Fly infestation had been common in areas of the Philippines specially in poultry farms which had caused problems in those farms and gave poultry animals diseases that could lead to sickness and harm for the income of those farmers. Meanwhile jackfruit sap being used as an adhesive for fly traps haven’t been tried before and the attractiveness of fermented rice water to flies is still being questioned.
