            <li>Materials: Dalandan peels, boiled water, measuring tools, spray solution, stopwatch, and live cockroaches.</li>

            <li>Procedure:Dalandan peels were divided into two groups—crushed and intact—then mixed with water at a 1:2 ratio and boiled. The solutions were sprayed on one side of an observation area.</li>

            <ul>Data Collection:
            Researchers measured:
                <li>Time taken for cockroaches to react</li>
                <li>Distance moved away from the spray</li>
                <li>Number of cockroaches that avoided the treated area</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Analysis:Results were recorded, averaged, and analyzed using the ANOVA test, with data presented through tables and graphs.</li>
