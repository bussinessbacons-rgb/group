        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Materials: Jackfruit sap, fermented rice water, yeast, containers, parchment paper, and basic tools.</li>

            <li>Procedure:
            Jackfruit sap was extracted and spread on parchment paper as an adhesive. Rice water was fermented for three days and placed beneath the adhesive as an attractant. Small holes were made to allow the odor to escape. </li>

            <li>Testing:
            Five setups were observed at different time intervals (2–6 hours). The number of trapped flies was recorded. </li>

            <li>Data Analysis:
            Results were compared and presented using bar graphs to measure effectiveness.</li>
