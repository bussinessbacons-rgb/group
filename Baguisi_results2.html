            The results showed that Dalandan peel solutions caused cockroaches to react by moving away from the sprayed area. Cockroaches exposed to the spray demonstrated measurable reaction times, traveled distances away from the source, and showed avoidance behavior. This indicates that Dalandan peels possess repellent properties, supporting their potential use as a natural insecticide.
