       <p>
            Dengue remains a major health concern in Philippine public schools, where students are highly exposed to mosquito breeding sites. 
            The harmful effects of chemical larvicides highlight the need for safer, natural alternatives. 
            This study aims to determine the effectiveness of Annona muricata seed extract against 
            Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae and eggs in selected public schools in Marikina City.
            <br><br>
            Specifically, this study seeks to answer the following questions:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Does Annona muricata seed extract cause mortality in Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae and eggs?</li>
            <li>Which concentration of the seed extract is most effective in inhibiting larval survival and egg hatching?</li>
            <li>Can Annona muricata seed extract serve as a safe and eco-friendly alternative to chemical larvicides in schools?</li>
        </ol>
