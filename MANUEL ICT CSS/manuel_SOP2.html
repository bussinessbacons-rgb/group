          Traditional leather is widely used but raises environmental and ethical concerns, prompting the search for sustainable alternatives. This study investigates the potential of Janitor fish skin (Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus) as an alternative by assessing its durability, strength, and performance characteristics compared to conventional leather.
            <br><br>
            Specifically, this study seeks to answer the following questions:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>How does the durability and tensile strength of Janitor fish skin compare to that of traditional leather?</li>
            <li>Does fish skin exhibit performance characteristics suitable for practical leather applications?</li>
            <li>Can Janitor fish skin be considered a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional leather?</li>
