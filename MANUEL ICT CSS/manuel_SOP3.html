        <p>
            Dengue remains a major public health concern in the Philippines, particularly among children who are often exposed to mosquito breeding sites in school environments. The increasing population of <em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquitoes, combined with inadequate sanitation and the continued use of chemical-based larvicides, poses risks to human health and the environment. Despite the known medicinal properties of <em>Annona muricata</em> (guyabano), limited studies focus on the antimicrobial and larvicidal potential of its seeds for community-based mosquito control.
            <br><br>
            Specifically, this study seeks to answer the following questions:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>What is the effect of <em>Annona muricata</em> seed extract on the mortality of <em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquito larvae?</li>
            <li>Is there a significant difference in larval mortality when exposed to varying concentrations of the seed extract?</li>
            <li>Which concentration of <em>Annona muricata</em> seed extract is most effective in eliminating mosquito larvae?</li>
            <li>Can <em>Annona muricata</em> seed extract be considered a safe and eco-friendly alternative to chemical larvicides used in schools?</li>
