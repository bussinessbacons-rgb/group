		    <h1>Methodology</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>This study evaluates Janitor fish skin as an alternative to traditional leather by comparing tensile strength, flexibility, and friction-wear resistance. Fish skin and leather samples will be prepared under controlled conditions and tested using standard methods, including a universal testing machine for tensile strength, folding for flexibility, and repeated abrasion for wear resistance. All tests will be conducted with uniform sample sizes and multiple replicates. The results will determine whether fish skin is a durable and sustainable alternative to conventional leather.</p>
