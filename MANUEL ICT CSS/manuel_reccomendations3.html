            It is recommended that schools consider using Annona muricata seed extract as an eco-friendly larvicide to help control Aedes aegypti mosquito populations in learning areas. Future studies should evaluate the long-term safety of the extract on non-target organisms and explore combining it with other natural plant extracts to improve effectiveness. Local government units and health agencies may support the development and distribution of organic mosquito control products. Community awareness programs should also be strengthened to promote sustainable and environmentally safe mosquito prevention practices. Additionally, continuous research could focus on optimizing extract concentrations and application methods to maximize larvicidal efficiency while maintaining safety for students and staff.
