			<p>The study expects that Annona muricata seed extract will exhibit significant antimicrobial and larvicidal effects against Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae and eggs. It is anticipated that higher concentrations of the extract, particularly the 20% and 40% treatments, will result in increased larval mortality and reduced egg hatching compared to the control group. A dose-dependent relationship is expected, wherein larval mortality increases as extract concentration increases. Statistical analysis is expected to show a significant difference between treated and untreated groups, indicating the effectiveness of the seed extract. The findings are expected to support the potential use of Annona muricata seed extract as a natural, eco-friendly, and low-cost alternative to chemical-based larvicides, especially in public school settings where children are highly vulnerable to dengue transmission. </p>
