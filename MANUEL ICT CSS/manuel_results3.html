                The study expects that exposing sugar cane (Saccharum) to varying soil pH levels in a controlled growth chamber system will result in noticeable differences in its photosynthetic rate. It is anticipated that sugar cane grown under near-neutral soil pH conditions will demonstrate the highest photosynthetic efficiency due to optimal nutrient availability and favorable root absorption processes. In contrast, plants exposed to highly acidic or alkaline soil conditions are expected to exhibit reduced photosynthetic rates as a result of nutrient imbalances, limited uptake of essential minerals, and increased physiological stress. As soil pH moves further away from the optimal range, a gradual decline in photosynthetic activity is expected, indicating a strong relationship between soil pH and plant physiological performance. Statistical analysis is expected to reveal significant differences among the different pH treatments, supporting the hypothesis that soil pH plays a crucial role in influencing the photosynthetic rate of sugar cane. These findings are expected to contribute to a better understanding of the ideal soil pH conditions needed to maximize sugar cane productivity and may provide useful information for improving crop management practices in controlled and agricultural environments.
