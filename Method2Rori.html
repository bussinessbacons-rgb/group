			This research employs a descriptive qualitative research design focusing on characters from selected narrative-driven games. Data are gathered through in-depth character analysis and player feedback surveys to capture both design features and emotional responses. The analysis combines psychological principles with thematic analysis to identify how specific design elements influence player engagement and emotional attachment. </p>
