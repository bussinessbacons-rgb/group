			<hr>
			<p>
			Based on the findings, it is recommended that game designers deliberately align narrative goals with gameplay mechanics to create cohesive player experiences. Developers should also incorporate formal game analysis frameworks throughout the design and development process rather than relying solely on intuition. Future research should expand this analysis by including direct player perception and experiential feedback to further validate design effectiveness. </p>
