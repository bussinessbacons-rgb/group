			<p>
			It is recommended that game designers integrate psychological principles into the character creation process to enhance emotional resonance. Developers should also conduct early testing of character designs with target player groups to gather meaningful feedback. Future research should explore how cultural background and social context influence player perceptions of game characters. </p>
