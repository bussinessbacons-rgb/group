			<p>
			Game developers are encouraged to adopt formal game analysis frameworks during the early stages of game development to improve overall design quality. Educational institutions should incorporate structured game analysis methods into game design curricula to better prepare future developers. Further research should integrate game analysis frameworks with usability testing to strengthen evaluation outcomes. </p>
