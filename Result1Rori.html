			The findings indicate that games with strong alignment between narrative elements and gameplay mechanics demonstrate higher levels of player engagement and immersion. Conversely, inconsistencies between story and gameplay were found to disrupt player experience and weaken narrative impact. The use of structured game analysis frameworks also improved the clarity and consistency of evaluation, allowing for more systematic identification of design strengths and weaknesses. </p>
