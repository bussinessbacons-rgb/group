			<hr>
			<p>
			Many modern digital games suffer from a lack of coherence between their narrative elements and gameplay mechanics, resulting in fragmented player experiences. When gameplay systems do not support or reflect the story being told, players often experience disengagement and reduced immersion. Additionally, there is limited academic research that applies structured and formal game analysis frameworks to systematically evaluate the relationship between narrative and mechanics, creating a gap in both scholarly understanding and practical design guidance. </p>
