			<p>
			Poorly designed game characters can significantly reduce player immersion and overall engagement in digital games. Emotional engagement, despite being a critical component of narrative-driven gameplay, is often overlooked during character development. Furthermore, there is insufficient academic research that integrates psychological theory with game character design, limiting designers’ ability to create emotionally compelling and relatable characters. </p>
