			<hr>
			<p>
			Many digital games are developed without the use of formal analytical evaluation methods, leading to overlooked design flaws that negatively affect player experience. Player experience issues are often identified too late in the development process, making them costly and difficult to address. Additionally, developers frequently lack systematic tools for assessing gameplay quality, usability, and engagement in a structured and repeatable manner. </p>
