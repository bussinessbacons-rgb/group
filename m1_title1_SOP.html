        <h1>Statement of the Problem</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Plastic waste has become a serious environmental problem in urban areas such as Marikina City,
            contributing to pollution, flooding, and marine ecosystem degradation. Conventional plastics are
            non-biodegradable and pose long-term risks to the environment. This situation highlights the need
            for sustainable and locally sourced alternatives.
            <br><br>
            Cassava starch (Manihot esculenta) is an abundant and renewable agricultural resource, while chitosan
            derived from chitin found in marine waste from Manila Bay offers potential as a natural biopolymer.
            However, limited local studies have explored the combined use of cassava starch and chitosan for
            bioplastic production.
            <br><br>
            This study aims to determine the feasibility of developing a localized bioplastic using cassava
            starch and Manila Bay chitosan.

            <li>Can cassava starch be effectively used as a base material for bioplastic production?</li>
            <li>Does the addition of chitosan improve the strength and flexibility of cassava-based bioplastic?</li>
            <li>Is the developed bioplastic a viable and eco-friendly alternative to conventional plastic materials?</li>
