        <hr>
        <p>
            It is recommended that future studies explore different ratios of cassava starch and chitosan to
            further improve the mechanical properties of the bioplastic. Additional tests such as water
            resistance, biodegradation rate, and shelf-life evaluation may also be conducted.
            <br><br>
            Local government units, schools, and small-scale manufacturers are encouraged to consider the use
            of cassava-based bioplastics as an alternative to single-use plastics. Further research may also
            focus on large-scale production and cost-effectiveness to promote sustainable material development
            in Marikina City.
