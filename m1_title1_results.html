            The study is expected to show that cassava starch can be successfully processed into a bioplastic
            material when combined with chitosan derived from Manila Bay. The resulting bioplastic is anticipated
            to exhibit improved tensile strength, flexibility, and durability compared to cassava starch alone.
            <br><br>
            Samples with higher chitosan content are expected to demonstrate enhanced resistance to tearing
            and better structural integrity. Additionally, the bioplastic is expected to be biodegradable,
            indicating its potential to reduce plastic waste accumulation.
            <br><br>
            Overall, the results are expected to support the feasibility of producing a localized, eco-friendly
            bioplastic using readily available agricultural and marine resources.
