        <p>
            It is recommended that future studies explore blending corn husk pulp with long-fiber materials to improve paper strength and tear resistance.
            Further research may also focus on optimizing pulping conditions and large-scale production methods.
            The utilization of corn husk for paper production should be encouraged to reduce agricultural waste and promote environmental sustainability.
