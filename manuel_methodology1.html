		    <h1>Methodology</h1>
			<hr>
			<p> This study employs a quantitative experimental research design to evaluate the antimicrobial and larvicidal properties of Annona muricata seed extract against mosquito larvae and eggs. Powderized guyabano seeds will be prepared and subjected to extraction using ethanol and distilled water through maceration. The resulting extract will be filtered and diluted to produce varying concentrations, namely 0% (control), 5%, 10%, 20%, and 40%. Two groups of mosquito larvae will be used in the experiment: Aedes aegypti (dengue carrier) and non-dengue carrier Culicidae mosquitoes. Equal numbers of larvae and eggs will be placed in controlled containers and treated with the designated extract concentrations. Observations will be conducted at specific time intervals to record larval mortality and egg hatching inhibition. Environmental factors such as temperature will be monitored to ensure consistency throughout the experiment. The collected data will be analyzed using percentage mortality and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to determine whether there is a significant difference in larvicidal effectiveness among the treatments. The results will be used to assess the feasibility of developing an eco-friendly larvicidal spray prototype suitable for school environments.</p>
