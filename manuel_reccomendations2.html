		    <h1>Recommendations</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>It is recommended that future studies explore the large-scale processing and commercialization of Janitor fish skin as a leather alternative, including investigations into long-term durability, finishing techniques, and potential applications in different product types. Designers, manufacturers, and environmental advocates may consider using fish skin to promote sustainability, reduce waste, and utilize aquaculture byproducts, contributing to eco-friendly practices in the leather and fashion industries. Furthermore, continuous research could focus on improving texture, flexibility, and aesthetic appeal to match industry standards.</p>
