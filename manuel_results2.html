                <p>The study is expected to demonstrate that Janitor fish skin has comparable durability and performance characteristics to traditional leather. Fish skin samples are anticipated to show adequate tensile strength, flexibility, and resistance to friction and wear, indicating their suitability for practical applications in fashion and manufacturing. Additionally, the findings may reveal slight differences in texture or resistance compared to conventional leather, providing insights into how fish skin can be processed and treated for optimal use. Overall, the results are expected to support the viability of fish skin as a functional and sustainable alternative material.</p>
