		    <h1>Statement of the Problem</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>Flooding is one of the most common disasters in the Philippines, and it often creates dangerous conditions for communities, especially at night or during power outages. In these situations, people may need to move through flooded areas, but it is difficult to determine floodwater depth using only the naked eye, particularly when visibility is low. Relying on estimation can lead to unsafe decisions, while standard measuring tools (such as rulers or measuring sticks) are not practical to use during an emergency</p>
			<p>To address this problem, the researchers will design and evaluate a dual-purpose flashlight that can illuminate the surroundings while also providing an immediate floodwater depth measurement. The study will test the accuracy of the floodwater-depth sensing flashlight under different turbidity and water volume (depth) levels, and determine whether these conditions affect the device’s performance.</p>
			<p> Specifically, this study will seek to answer the following questions: </p>
			<ol>
			    <li>Is there a significant difference in the accuracy of the floodwater-depth sensing flashlight compared to standard measuring tools?</li>
				<li>Does the brightness of the flashlight affect the accuracy of measuring floodwater depth?</li>
				<li>Does the turbidity of the floodwater affect the accuracy of the floodwater-depth sensing flashlight?</li>
			</ol>
