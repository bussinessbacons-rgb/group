		    <h1>Methodology</h1>
			<hr>
			<h3>Materials</h3>
			<p>The project uses a mobile robotic platform equipped with a microcontroller (such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi) to serve as the system’s core. It includes camera modules for real-time monitoring and image processing, motion sensors for detecting sudden posture changes, GPS for accurate location reporting, and speakers for voice interaction. The system is powered by lithium batteries for continuous operation. Software tools like OpenCV and machine learning programs analyze movements and responsiveness, while data logging and a user-friendly interface allow medical staff to review incidents and manage settings efficiently.</p>
		    <h3>Experiment</h3>
			<p>The experiment involves developing and testing the robot-based system in a controlled hospital environment. Simulated fainting scenarios with volunteer participants are used to evaluate the robot’s ability to detect fainting incidents accurately. The system’s performance is measured based on detection accuracy, response time, false positives, communication effectiveness, and usability. The goal is to assess the reliability of the robot in providing timely alerts and assistance during fainting incidents to improve patient safety and emergency response.</p>
