			<hr>
			<h3>Methods</h3>
			    <ul>
				    <li>The flashlight is designed as a handheld dual-purpose device.</li>
					<li>An Arduino microcontroller processes data from:
					    <ul>
						    <li>Ultrasonic sensor for depth measurement</li>
							<li>Turbidity sensor for water clarity classification</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>An LED provides illumination with adjustable brightness.</li>
					<li>Water depth readings are displayed on an LCD screen.</li>
					<li>All components are enclosed in a flashlight casing.</li>
					<li>The device is powered by a rechargeable battery.</li>
					<li>The experiment is conducted indoors using a plastic container.</li>
					<li>Water depths from 5 cm to 25 cm are tested.</li>
					<li>Three water conditions are prepared:
					    <ul>
						    <li>Clear water</li>
							<li>Low turbidity (soil added)</li>
							<li>High turbidity (more soil added)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The flashlight is kept at a fixed height above the water surface.</li>
					<li>A ruler is used to record the actual water depth for comparison.</li>
