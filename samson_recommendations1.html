		    <h1>Recommendations</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>	Based on the results and conclusions of the study, the following recommendations from the researchers are offered.</p>
			<ul>
			    <li> In the first making of the organic candles, the researchers did not mix the bees wax with the essence that was made with the plants and oil. The mistake resulted in the candle not having much scent when in use. The recommendation of the researchers is mixing the bees wax and the essence together when boiling the bees wax so that it could be more effective. </li>
				<li> The researchers only tried 3 (three) plants for their study so the recommendation that they are offering is to use different plants to fully explore many alternatives and experiment which can be more effective when the candle is used by more people. </li>
				<li> For more production of candles, they hope that it can be done by batch rather than making one at a time. This is a more efficient way to make the organic candles so that no time or ingredients are wasted. </li>
