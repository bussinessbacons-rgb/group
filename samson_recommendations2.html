		    <h1>Recommendations</h1>
			<hr>
			<ul>
			    <li> Future studies should improve the ORION device by integrating additional health sensors to enhance detection accuracy. </li>
				<li> Testing in wider hospital areas is recommended to ensure reliability in real-world conditions. </li>
				<li> Further training of machine learning models can help reduce false detections. Integration with hospital information systems and proper staff training are also suggested. </li>
				<li> Lastly, long-term and large-scale testing is recommended to evaluate the device’s effectiveness, safety, and practicality before full implementation. </li>
