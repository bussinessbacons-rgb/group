		    <h1>Results</h1>
			<hr>
			<ul>
			    <li> The device did not detect any abnormal changes in pulse or temperature, and no emergency indicators such as buzzers or red LEDs were triggered.</li>
				<li> The participant reported feeling normal before sleep, without any dizziness, lightheadedness, or discomfort. </li>
				<li> Both the device and participant have reported normal conditions. </li>
				<li> The participant briefly woke up but returned to sleep shortly after, with no noticeable changes in body temperature or heartbeat. </li>
				<li> Minimal movement was recorded on nights 1 and 2 with the robot, while increased movement was noted on nights without it. </li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>This study developed the Observational Robotic Intervention for Optimized Notifications (ORION) to improve the detection and response to fainting incidents in hospital settings. ORION demonstrated its ability to monitor vital signs, distinguish fainting episodes from other conditions and trigger timely alerts without false detections, ultimately enhancing emergency response and reducing the workload on healthcare staff. While the study provides promising results, it is limited by factors such as participant demographics and controlled testing conditions. These constraints suggest the need for further research to validate ORION’s effectiveness in diverse healthcare environments. Future studies should focus on refining its detection algorithms and assessing its long-term impact on patient safety and hospital efficiency.</p>
