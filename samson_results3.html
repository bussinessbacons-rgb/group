			<ul>
			    <li> The floodwater-depth sensing flashlight is expected to measure water depth accurately and consistently compared to a standard ruler.</li>
				<li> The device is expected to perform best in clear and low-turbidity water, with only minor errors in highly turbid conditions. </li>
				<li> Flashlight brightness is expected to have no significant effect on measurement accuracy. </li>
				<li> Most test results are expected to show no significant difference between flashlight readings and actual water depth (p > 0.05). </li>
